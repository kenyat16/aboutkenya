 Hi, I'm Teresa Miguel

I'm an Aerospace Engineering student with a passion for coding simulations, exploring physics with Python and MATLAB, and building tools that solve real-world engineering problems.


 I'm currently learning and working on:
- Physics-based simulations (projectile motion, rocket dynamics)
- Python and MATLAB for engineering applications
- Git, GitHub, and clean code documentation

My core skills and tools:
Python | MATLAB | NumPy | Matplotlib | Git | Jupyter Notebooks

 Projects I'm working on:
-  Projectile Motion Simualtor
-  Data visualization tools for aerospace data
-  Orbital mechanics explorer (coming soon)!

 I'm using GitHub to:
- Document and track my learning
- Build a public portfolio of simulations and code
- Collaborate and contribute to open-source projects in STEM
