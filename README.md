 Hi, I'm Teresa Miguel

I'm an Aerospace Engineering student with a passion for coding simulations, exploring physics with Python and MATLAB, and building tools that solve real-world engineering problems.


 I'm currently learning and working on:
- Physics-based simulations (projectile motion, rocket dynamics)
- Python and MATLAB for engineering applications
- Git, GitHub, and clean code documentation

My core skills and tools:
Python | MATLAB | NumPy | Matplotlib | Git | Jupyter Notebooks

📈 Projects I'm building:
- 🚀 [Projectile Motion Simulator]
- 📊 Data visualization tools for aerospace data
- 🛰️ Orbital mechanics explorer (coming soon!

 I'm using GitHub to:
- Document and track my learning
- Build a public portfolio of simulations and code
- Collaborate and contribute to open-source projects in STEM
